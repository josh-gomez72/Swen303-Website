# Swen303-Website

A small website I made that communicated with an xml database of letters from the Colenso project.
The site was made using node and the main goal was to show the letters in a presentable way and be able to perform queries on the database such as,
find particular letters containing keywords or tags, use logical operators, easily edit a letter, download a letter and add new ones to the database.
